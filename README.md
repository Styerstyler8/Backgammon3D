# Backgammon3D
Recreated the board game Backgammon in Unity using C# and implemented an AI that uses Monte Carlo Tree Search

Players can play against another player locally, or can play against an AI with configurable settings. 
Information is displayed about the AI's decision making, where each possible move has a win percentage next to it.
